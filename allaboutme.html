		<p style = "color:white";> As you can probably tell, my name is Queen Carrasco. I'm a rising sophomore at Brooklyn Tech. I'm currently interested in art, comp sci and possibly, law. My hobbies include: listening to music, drawing, painting, watching Youtube and binging shows on Netflix. 
		
		My favorite hobby is drawing. As a child, I wanted to be a fashion designer and so my mother encouraged me to draw on the bus, train or anywhere where people were. Since then, I've filled countlesss sketchbooks, ranging from goofy cartoon characters to serious expressions. I like to go to the park whenever I can and sketch the scenery around me. Art has become a calming part of my life which I enjoy deeply. </p>
